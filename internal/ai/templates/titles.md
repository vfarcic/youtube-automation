Generate 10 compelling and SEO-friendly YouTube video titles based on the provided manuscript. Target 56-65 characters for optimal performance (acceptable range: 55-75 characters maximum).

CRITICAL: Front-load the hook in the first 60 characters (mobile truncation point). Prioritize these proven high-performing patterns:

1. Provocative Opinion + Technical Specificity (3-5x avg views)
   - Include strong stance or controversial angle
   - Use qualifiers: "Maybe", "Brutally Honest", rhetorical questions
   - Example: "Why I Changed My Mind About Backstage? A Brutally Honest Opinion"

2. "Top N" Lists with Year Specificity (highest view counts)
   - Use numbered lists (Top 5, Top 10)
   - Include current year (2025)
   - Use imperative language: "MUST Use", "Essential"
   - Example: "Top 10 DevOps Tools You MUST Use in 2025!"

3. Direct Comparisons ("X vs Y") (35% higher watch time)
   - Compare 2-3 specific tools/technologies
   - Add compelling modifier: "Showdown!", "Is It Time to Ditch X?"
   - Example: "Cursor vs. GitHub Copilot: AI Coding Showdown!"

4. Challenge/Disruptive Statement + Solution (2.8% engagement vs 1.9% avg)
   - Use: "Stop Using...", "Say Goodbye to...", "Forget..."
   - Present immediate alternative
   - Example: "Stop Using Docker for Dev Environments! (feat. Okteto)"

5. Personal Workflow/Journey (65% higher comment rate)
   - First-person perspective: "My", "How I"
   - Show specific transformation or outcome
   - Example: "My Workflow With AI: How I Code, Test, and Deploy Faster Than Ever"

AVOID these proven low-performing patterns:
- Generic "How To" or "Using" openings (52% fewer likes per view)
- "Explained" or "Tutorial" suffix (62% lower views)
- Question-only titles without controversy (54% lower watch time)
- Overly technical without context (80% lower comment rate)
- Titles over 75 characters (8-12% CTR drop per 10 extra chars)

IMPORTANT: You must respond with ONLY a valid JSON array of strings. No explanations, no markdown formatting, no additional text. Just the JSON array.

Example format: ["Title 1", "Title 2", "Title 3", "Title 4", "Title 5", "Title 6", "Title 7", "Title 8", "Title 9", "Title 10"]
