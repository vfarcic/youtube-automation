# Product Requirements Document: Add Confirmation Before Deletion in CLI

## Overview
Currently, the project CLI allows deletion of tasks, files, or other resources without always requiring explicit user confirmation. This can lead to accidental data loss. This PRD proposes adding a confirmation prompt before any destructive (delete) action is performed through the CLI, unless an explicit override flag is provided.

## Objectives
1. Prevent accidental deletion of tasks, files, or resources via the CLI
2. Require user confirmation before executing any delete command
3. Allow advanced users to bypass confirmation with a force flag (e.g., `--yes` or `-y`)
4. Ensure consistent behavior across all CLI delete operations
5. Add tests to verify confirmation logic

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements
1. Audit all CLI commands that perform deletions (tasks, subtasks, files, etc.)
2. Implement a confirmation prompt for each destructive command
3. Add a `--yes` or `-y` flag to allow skipping confirmation (for scripting/automation)
4. Ensure the prompt is clear, e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete [resource]? (y/N)"
5. If the user declines, abort the operation with a clear message
6. Add unit and integration tests for confirmation logic
7. Update CLI documentation and help output to reflect the new behavior

### User Experience Requirements
1. Default behavior should be safe: require confirmation unless explicitly overridden
2. The confirmation prompt should be clear and unambiguous
3. Users should be able to bypass confirmation for automation or advanced use cases
4. Error and abort messages should be user-friendly

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. The change should not introduce significant latency to CLI operations
2. The implementation should be consistent with existing CLI design patterns
3. The solution should be backward compatible (existing scripts using `--yes` should not break)

## Constraints
1. Only affect CLI-based delete operations (not API or UI)
2. Avoid breaking changes for users who already use `--yes`/`-y` flags
3. Minimize disruption to other CLI features

## Success Criteria
1. All destructive CLI commands require confirmation by default
2. Users can bypass confirmation with a documented flag
3. No accidental deletions are reported after implementation
4. All related tests pass

## Out of Scope
1. Changes to non-CLI interfaces (API, UI, etc.)
2. Redesigning unrelated CLI commands
3. Adding new types of delete operations
