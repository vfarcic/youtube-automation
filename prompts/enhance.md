Referenced file is a manuscript for a YouTube video in markdown format.

**Core Principle: Transform technical manuscripts into highly engaging, retention-focused YouTube content while preserving the author's expertise and authenticity.**

## PRIMARY FOCUS: ENGAGEMENT & RETENTION

### FIXME Headers (MANDATORY)
- **ALL lines that start with `## FIXME:` MUST be rewritten** into compelling section titles that create interest
- **Never leave a FIXME header unchanged** - they are placeholders that must be replaced
- Make headers specific and engaging, not just descriptive (e.g., "The Shocking Results" vs "Results") 
- Do NOT add new sections. Only rename existing FIXME sections.
- Headers should build narrative momentum and create anticipation

### Hook Creation (MANDATORY)
- **Rewrite the intro** to hook viewers in the first 15 seconds with:
  1. **Problem/Conflict**: Start with tension, failure, or surprising result
  2. **Promise**: Clearly state what viewers will learn and why it matters
  3. **Preview**: Tease the most interesting findings/conclusions to create curiosity loops
- Use pattern interrupts, unexpected statements, or contrarian takes
- Make viewers think "I need to see how this turns out"

### Content Restructuring for Retention
- **Add retention hooks every 30-60 seconds**: "But here's where it gets interesting...", "Wait until you see what happened next...", "This is where everything changed..."
- **Create curiosity gaps**: Reference interesting results/conclusions early, then make viewers wait for the payoff
- **Use the Rule of 3**: Present information in groups of three for better retention
- **Add narrative tension**: Frame technical comparisons as competitions, battles, or mysteries to solve

### Pacing and Energy Management
- **Vary sentence length**: Mix short punchy statements with longer explanations
- **Add conversational connectors**: "Now here's the thing...", "But wait, there's more...", "You're probably thinking..."
- **Create momentum**: Use phrases that push viewers forward: "Let's dive in", "Now watch this", "Here's where it gets crazy"
- **Strategic pauses and emphasis**: Mark moments where the author should slow down or speed up

### Visual and Engagement Cues
- **MANDATORY: Use bold formatting for key phrases, statistics, and important terms** that should be highlighted with in-video text animations
- **Bold text indicates moments for on-screen text overlays** during video editing
- Examples of what to bold: `**60% reduction**`, `**fully autonomous**`, `**completely failed**`, `**game-changing results**`
- Suggest moments for visual emphasis (charts, graphics, side-by-side comparisons)
- Mark opportunities for on-screen text highlights of key points

### Section Structure for Engagement
- **Add preview/summary elements**: Brief teasers of what's coming up
- **Create logical story flow**: Ensure each section builds tension toward a resolution
- **Use cliffhangers**: End sections with hooks that make viewers want to continue

## CONTENT ENHANCEMENT STRATEGIES

### Make Technical Content Accessible
- **Add context for technical concepts**: Briefly explain why something matters before diving into details
- **Use analogies and metaphors**: Relate complex technical concepts to everyday experiences
- **Anticipate viewer questions**: Add brief explanations for terms that might confuse non-experts
- **Highlight practical implications**: Connect technical details to real-world impact

### Strengthen the Narrative
- **Amplify conflict/tension**: Emphasize the competition between tools, the stakes, the potential consequences
- **Add emotional stakes**: Connect technical outcomes to broader implications (job security, industry change, etc.)
- **Create character development**: Present the tools/agents as having personalities, strengths, weaknesses
- **Build to a climax**: Structure the content so tension builds to a clear resolution

### Enhance Credibility and Authority
- **Strengthen expertise indicators**: Emphasize the author's experience and qualifications where appropriate
- **Add supporting evidence**: Suggest where additional data or examples would strengthen claims
- **Balance criticism with fairness**: Ensure critiques feel informed rather than arbitrary

## WHAT TO PRESERVE

### Authentic Voice
- Keep the author's direct, experienced, sometimes blunt communication style
- Preserve technical depth and honest assessments
- Maintain the "practitioner talking to practitioners" authenticity
- Don't add fake enthusiasm or marketing-speak

### Technical Integrity
- Keep all existing `TODO: Screen:` references exactly as written
- Preserve code citations and technical references
- Keep specific metrics, test results, and technical observations
- Don't dumb down content - make it accessible while maintaining depth

## WRITING STYLE PREFERENCES

### Punctuation and Formatting
- **Avoid using ` - ` (dash with spaces)** in sentences
- Use alternative constructions like periods, colons, or restructure sentences entirely
- Examples to avoid: "But here's the twist - I'm not sure", "The problem is - it doesn't work"
- Better alternatives: "But here's the twist: I'm not sure", "But here's the twist. I'm not sure", or "Here's the twist, though: I'm not sure"

## WHAT TO AVOID

- Don't sacrifice accuracy for engagement
- Don't add clickbait elements that don't deliver
- Don't change the fundamental conclusions or technical assessment
- Don't over-structure content that works better with natural flow
- Avoid tiny micro-edits (individual word changes, minor typo fixes) unless they significantly impact engagement

## OUTPUT APPROACH

- **Separate major structural changes from minor improvements**: 
  - **Major structural changes** (intro rewrites, section restructuring, adding many new elements) should be made in dedicated edits with clear explanations of what you're doing and why
  - **Minor improvements** (word changes, small additions, content tightening) can be made without explanation
- **Any improvements are encouraged** if they increase retention while preserving the author's voice and style
- **Content removal is welcome** if it eliminates boring/low-retention sections  
- **Word improvements are always allowed** for better engagement and flow

## POST-ENHANCEMENT CLEANUP (MANDATORY)

**After completing all manuscript enhancements:**

1. **Ask the user to review the enhanced manuscript**
2. **Request confirmation to delete all enhancement explanation comments**
3. **Only proceed with comment deletion after explicit user approval**
4. **Enhancement explanation comments should NOT remain in the final manuscript**

**Example request format:**
"I've completed enhancing your manuscript. Please review the changes and let me know if you'd like me to remove all the enhancement explanation comments (<!-- ENHANCEMENT EXPLANATION: ... -->) to clean up the final version."

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: EXPLANATION REQUIREMENTS ⚠️

**EXPLANATIONS MUST BE ADDED ABOVE EVERY PARAGRAPH/BLOCK THAT GETS CHANGED, NOT JUST MAJOR SECTIONS.**

### **MANDATORY EXPLANATION FORMAT:**
```
<!-- ENHANCEMENT EXPLANATION:
**What changed:** [Brief description of the specific change to this paragraph/block]
**Why:** [Reason focused on engagement/retention improvement]
**Impact:** [Expected viewer behavior improvement]
-->
```

### **WHEN TO ADD EXPLANATIONS:**
- **EVERY paragraph that gets rewritten or significantly modified**
- **EVERY new paragraph or content block added**
- **EVERY section header transformation (FIXME changes)**
- **EVERY retention hook addition**
- **EVERY sentence that gets substantial modification for engagement**

### **WHEN EXPLANATIONS ARE NOT NEEDED:**
- Minor typo fixes (single word corrections)
- Grammar corrections that don't change meaning
- Punctuation adjustments
- Single word replacements for better flow (unless it significantly changes engagement)

### **EXPLANATION PLACEMENT RULES:**
1. **Place explanation directly above the changed content**
2. **If multiple consecutive paragraphs change, add explanation above each one**
3. **For section headers, place explanation above the new header**
4. **For new content, place explanation above the new content**

**EXAMPLE CORRECT FORMAT:**
```markdown
<!-- ENHANCEMENT EXPLANATION:
**What changed:** Added retention hook "But here's where it gets interesting..."
**Why:** Creates curiosity gap and prevents viewer drop-off at this transition point
**Impact:** Maintains engagement as content shifts from setup to technical details
-->
But here's where it gets interesting...

<!-- ENHANCEMENT EXPLANATION:
**What changed:** Reframed technical description to emphasize competition between agents
**Why:** Competition framing creates emotional investment and makes technical comparison more engaging
**Impact:** Viewers will root for one agent over the other, maintaining attention through technical details
-->
Today, I'll give the task to implement that PRD to two fully autonomous agents, and they're about to battle it out.
```

**This ensures every change is documented and provides context for future edits while maintaining engagement focus.**

Make substantial changes that meaningfully improve retention and engagement
- Prioritize changes that help viewers stay engaged throughout the entire video

**Goal: Transform technical content into compelling YouTube videos that keep viewers watching while maintaining the author's expertise and authenticity.**
