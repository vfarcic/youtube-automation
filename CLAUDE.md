## Architecture Overview

### Core System Design
The YouTube Automation Tool is built around a **phase-based video lifecycle management system** with both CLI and REST API interfaces. Videos progress through 6 distinct phases from idea to post-publish activities.

### Key Architectural Components

#### 1. Video Lifecycle Phases (0-7)
- **Phase 0-6**: Active workflow phases (Ideas → Started → Material Done → Edit Requested → Publish Pending → Published → Delayed)
- **Phase 7**: Sponsored/Blocked videos (special handling)
- Each phase has specific completion criteria and field requirements

#### 2. Multi-Interface Architecture
- **CLI Mode**: Interactive terminal interface with huh forms (`internal/app/`)
- **API Mode**: REST server for programmatic access (`internal/api/`)
- **Shared Core**: Common business logic in `internal/service/` and `internal/storage/`

#### 3. Field Completion System
Uses reflection-based completion tracking via struct tags in `internal/storage/yaml.go`:
```go
type Video struct {
    Date string `json:"date" completion:"filled_only"`
    Code bool   `json:"code" completion:"true_only"`
    // ... other fields
}
```

Completion criteria: `filled_only`, `true_only`, `false_only`, `conditional_sponsorship`, `conditional_sponsors`, `empty_or_filled`, `no_fixme`

#### 4. AI Content Generation
- Integrated Azure OpenAI for titles, descriptions, tags, tweets, highlights
- Two API approaches: traditional (JSON payload) and optimized (URL parameters)
- Located in `internal/ai/` with individual modules per content type

#### 5. Publishing Integration
- **YouTube API**: Automated video uploads with OAuth2 (`internal/publishing/youtube.go`)
- **Hugo Integration**: Blog post generation (`internal/publishing/hugo.go`)
- **Solved Chicken-and-Egg Problem**: Video descriptions now include correct Hugo URLs upfront by pre-constructing them during upload

#### 6. Social Media Distribution
- BlueSky, LinkedIn, Slack posting capabilities
- Platform-specific modules in `internal/platform/`

### Data Flow Architecture

#### 1. Storage Layer (`internal/storage/`)
- YAML-based persistence for video metadata
- Index file tracks all videos across categories
- Individual YAML files per video with complete metadata

#### 2. Service Layer (`internal/service/`)
- `VideoService`: Unified data operations for CLI and API
- Handles CRUD operations, phase transitions, manuscript processing
- Abstracts storage details from interfaces

#### 3. Business Logic Layer
- **Aspect System** (`internal/aspect/`): Dynamic form generation and completion tracking
- **Video Manager** (`internal/video/`): Phase calculation and workflow management
- **Workflow** (`internal/workflow/`): Constants and phase definitions

#### 4. Interface Layer
- **CLI**: Menu-driven interface with phase-specific forms
- **API**: RESTful endpoints mirroring CLI functionality
- **Shared Validation**: Both interfaces use identical business rules

### Configuration System
- `settings.yaml` for global configuration
- Environment variables for sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- CLI flags with YAML path mapping (`internal/configuration/`)

### Hugo Integration Details
The system generates Hugo blog posts with deterministic URL construction:
- **URL Pattern**: `https://devopstoolkit.live/{category}/{sanitized-title}`
- **Title Sanitization**: Spaces→hyphens, remove special chars, lowercase
- **Path Mapping**: Manuscript categories map to Hugo content directories
- **Cross-Referencing**: Videos include blog post URLs, blog posts include YouTube embeds

### Testing Architecture
- **Mock-Based Testing**: External services (YouTube API, email) are mocked
- **Coverage Goal**: 80% test coverage with `./scripts/coverage.sh`
- **Test Organization**: Tests alongside source code, mocks in `pkg/mocks/`
- **Fixture System**: Test data in `pkg/testutil/testdata/`

### Key Patterns to Follow

#### 1. Phase-Based Development
When adding new functionality, consider which phase(s) it affects and update:
- Field completion criteria in struct tags
- Aspect definitions for dynamic forms
- Phase transition logic in video manager

#### 2. Interface Consistency
Both CLI and API should provide identical functionality:
- Share business logic through service layer
- Use same validation rules and error handling
- Maintain feature parity between interfaces

#### 3. AI Integration Pattern
When adding new AI features:
- Create dedicated module in `internal/ai/`
- Provide both traditional (JSON) and optimized (URL params) API endpoints
- Include proper error handling and retry logic

#### 4. Hugo URL Construction
For any Hugo-related functionality, use the established pattern:
- Extract category from manuscript path using `GetCategoryFromFilePath()`
- Sanitize titles using `SanitizeTitle()`
- Construct URLs using `ConstructHugoURL()`

This architecture supports the tool's evolution from simple video management to comprehensive content creation workflow automation while maintaining clean separation of concerns and interface consistency.
