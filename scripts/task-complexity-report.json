      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of confirmation for other resource deletion commands into specific subtasks, including identifying all resource types, implementing confirmation for each type, handling edge cases, testing, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task is slightly more complex than task 5 because it involves multiple resource types, each potentially with different deletion logic. The generic implementation needs to be adapted for each resource type, requiring more careful consideration of edge cases."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the integration testing task into specific subtasks covering test plan creation, automated test implementation, manual testing procedures, regression testing, performance verification, and final documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task has higher complexity due to its comprehensive nature, requiring testing across multiple commands and scenarios. It involves both automated and manual testing components, verification of edge cases, and final sign-off on the entire feature implementation."
