{"type":"entity","name":"Test-Driven Development","entityType":"Development Principle","observations":["Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development approach where tests are written before the code implementation.","TDD follows a red-green-refactor cycle: write a failing test, implement code to make it pass, then refactor while keeping tests passing.","Tests should be written for all new features and bug fixes before implementing the actual code.","The focus is on writing only the code necessary to pass the tests, avoiding over-engineering.","Benefits include better design, higher code quality, built-in regression testing, and clear specification of requirements.","When implementing new functionality for the YouTube Automation project, always start with writing tests first."]}
